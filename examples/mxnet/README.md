# Environment
1) Ubuntu 16.04
2) NVCC (we tried with both CUDA 9.0 and 9.2)
3) CUDA Driver (we tried with both 384.111 and 396.37)
4) GCC 5.4.0
5) Install all dependencies following steps for [standard MXNet install](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/index.html?platform=Linux&language=Python&processor=GPU&version=master#)

# Additional dependencies required compared to vanilla MXNet
1) MPI (we tested using OpenMPI 3.1.1 compiled with CUDA-aware)
2) NCCL (we tested with both NCCL 2.1 and 2.2)

# Building
1) git clone --recursive https://github.com/ctcyang/incubator-mxnet.git -b horovod
2) Verify that horovod is on branch: fp16_divide_before_sum
3) cd horovod & cp make/config.mk .
4) Only config.mk + Makefile build chain works. We have not added CMakeLists support yet. Make following changes to config.mk:
  ```
  USE_HOROVOD = 1
  USE_NCCL = 1
  USE_NCCL_PATH = [directory in which libnccl.so resides]
  USE_MPI_PATH = [root directory in which MPI folders /lib and /include reside]
  ```
5) make -j16

# Running
You can run the synthetic benchmark by doing (tested using OpenMPI 3.1.1 on AWS p3.16xlarge instances):

```mpirun -np 8 --hostfile ~/host_file --bind-to none --map-by slot -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -x NCCL_MIN_NRINGS=4 -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH -x MXNET_USE_OPERATOR_TUNING=0 -mca pml ob1 -mca btl ^openib python mxnet_imagenet_resnet50.py --benchmark 1 --batch-size=128 --network resnet-v1 --num-layers=50 --num-epochs 1 --kv-store horovod --dtype float32 --gpus 0```

Note the use of MXNET_USE_OPERATOR_TUNING=0 flag to disable OpenMP tuning. If this flag is not included, then starting up 8 MXNet processes will take upwards of 2 minutes. We find disabling this tuning does not affect performance.

To run on Imagenet data:

```mpirun -np 8 --hostfile ~/host_file --bind-to none --map-by slot -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -x NCCL_MIN_NRINGS=4 -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH -x MXNET_USE_OPERATOR_TUNING=0 -mca pml ob1 -mca btl ^openib python mxnet_imagenet_resnet50.py --batch-size=128 --network resnet-v1 --num-layers=50 --num-epochs 1 --kv-store horovod --dtype float32 --gpus 0 --data-nthreads 40```

# Testing
The following Horovod unit tests do not pass:
  * tests that check Horovod+MXNet throws the correct error if the user passes in NDArrays that differ in size
  * test for average variant of Horovod Allreduce (i.e. that performs a divide by number of workers). W havenâ€™t spent time debugging the reason

To run tests, we did:

```mpirun -np 8 --hostfile ~/host_file --bind-to none --map-by slot -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -x NCCL_MIN_NRINGS=4 -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH -x MXNET_USE_OPERATOR_TUNING=0 -mca pml ob1 -mca btl ^openib python test_mxnet.py```

# fp16 support
My latest branch that supports fp32 and fp16 is mxnet_fp16_divide_before_sum
  * however despite the name, the Horovod-MXNet prototype does not divide before summing. The division step has been left out, because MXNet is accustomed to do the division by effective batch size in Optimizer after Allreduce has been done.
